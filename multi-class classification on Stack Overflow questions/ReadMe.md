This dataset contains the body of several thousand programming questions (for example, "How can I sort a dictionary by value in Python?") posted to Stack Overflow. Each of these is labeled with exactly one tag (either Python, CSharp, JavaScript, or Java). Your task is to take a question as input, and predict the appropriate tag, in this case, Python.
